# Nothing.app

Master's thesis description:
> The purpose of the following Masterâ€™s Thesis was to present a feasibility study of an application to manage notifications on mobile devices with iOS operating system. For the purpose of the thesis, a Swift language application was created. The application uses iCloud service to synchronise user's data between devices associated with the same Apple ID account.
In the thesis, an overview and analysis of existing apps on the market was performed. The thesis also covers a development process of the created application and presents overview of the Swift language used to create the application.

I decided to wrote app in Swift because I wanted to learn the language and learn Core Data a bit more too. 
Some part of code might need improvements.

Feel free to use this code where you want.
